# Exposure of malware in a crack of the minecraft utility client Astolfo

# Changes in this pull request:

Cleared up what this malware actually is and removed the transphobic comment in the original repo. Why would you even throw one in there to begin with.
Made the code more readable.

# What is this malware?

This malware is a phishing tool/detail sniffer, stealing data for impersonation over Discord, accounts for the utility client Future, etc etc, and it sends the stolen information to a discord server. It is NOT a remote administration tool (RAT)

# what it does:

- Logs your Discord Token
- Steals Alts stored in the alts profile of the Future client
- Steals MC Tokens, Usernames, and Emails from any accounts saved in launcher_profiles.json
- Steals the contents of your mods directory
- Steals HWID, OS and username (possibly IP address)
- Takes a screenshot of your PC (disguised in user documents folder under \Documents\fix.png)
